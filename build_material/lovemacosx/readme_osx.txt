== OSX stuff ==

Prior starting the first time you need to run prepare_osx.sh (open with -> iTerm.app).
This will install some libs and create a blank config file (if necessary).
It will also open your config file with your default editor.

To run the game just start the start.sh (open with -> iTerm.app).

To update the game run update.sh (open with -> iTerm.app).


NOTE the combat-prototype directory is the LÃ–VE2d game root
